| 100 Gbps PON |   |   | **100 Gbps PON** is the name we have designated for generations of passive optical network (PON) technologies beyond XG-PON1 and XG-PON2 (10 Gps PON). There is no standardization as yet. The technology will deliver typical access bandwidths of up to 100 Gbps and may use elements of current PON technologies. |
| 10g-pon |   |   | **10 Gbps passive optical network (10G-PON)** is a next-generation solution following the current-generation gigabit passive optical network (GPON) (ITU-T G.984) and Ethernet passive optical network (EPON) (IEEE 802.3ah) solutions, basically offering higher bandwidth and additional features. Like its predecessors, 10G-PON will allow multiple users to share the capacity over a passive fiber-optic “tree” infrastructure, where the fibers to individual users branch out from a single fiber running to a network node. In September 2009, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) approved 802.3av as a 10G-EPON standard, including both 10/1 Gbps and symmetrical 10 Gbps implementations. In October 2010, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) approved the ITU-T G.987.1 and G.987.2 10G-PON standards with asymmetrical and symmetrical implementations.Asymmetrical 10G-PON (specified by the Full Service Access Network [FSAN] as XG-PON1) provides 10 Gbps downstream and 2.5 Gbps upstream. Symmetrical 10G-PON (specified by FSAN as XG-PON2) provides 10 Gbps both ways.10G-PON uses different downstream and upstream wavelengths (1,577 nanometers [nm] and 1,270nm respectively) to those used by GPON, so that both systems can coexist on the same fiber architecture. This allows communications service providers (CSPs) to supply GPON services to the majority of their subscribers, while providing higher-bandwidth 10G-PON to premium subscribers, such as enterprises, or for the deployment of broadband to high-density multidwelling units.  |
| 1xRTT (CDMA2000 1x) |   |   | A 2.5G transmission technology; an evolution of cdma2000 that adds voice capacity and supports peak downlink data rates of up to 144 Kbps in a single 1.25MHz channel, typically delivering 80 Kbps to 100 Kbps in the field.  |
| 2.5G |   |   | Enhancements that provide packet data capabilities over 2G networks. 2.5G improves the available data rates supported by the air interface, thereby permitting the introduction of new, data-oriented services and applications. The increased data rates rise to a theoretical maximum of 384 Kbps, although in the field available data rates may often be as low as 20 Kbps. General packet radio service (GPRS) is an example of a 2.5G technology.  |
| 2D Bar Code Marketing |   |   | **2D bar code marketing** is an identification method that can be created and printed on marketing materials, such as ads, brochures and product packages, through specific service providers or freely available websites. More commonly known as quick response (QR) codes, people scan these bar codes with a camera-equipped phone to access information such as websites and product details, or they download content such as coupons and business cards onto mobile devices.   |
| 2G (Second Generation) |   |   | The second generation of wireless networks designed to improve on analog with digital circuit-switched solutions. The three main 2G technology standards are Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), which is based on European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) standards, time division multiple access (TDMA) IS-136 and code division multiple access (CDMA). The Japanese personal digital cellular (PDC) standard was similar to IS-136. GSM and IS-136 are TDMA technologies. 2G services typically support data rates of 9.6 Kbps, 14.4 Kbps and up to 64 Kbps in certain IS-95B deployments.  |
| 3.5G |   |   | A broad term referring to enhancements that provide high-speed data extensions to 3G (wideband code division multiple access [WCDMA]) that go beyond the 384 Kbps downlink and 64 Kbps uplink provided by basic WCDMA. The term 3.5G covers technologies such as High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), High-Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) and HSPA+.  |
| 3D Bioprinting |   |   | **Three-dimensional bioprinting** is a medical application of 3D printers. It is a system directed by medical imaging data and software that specifies the design of living tissue and organs, plus the printing device to create a functioning human organ from an individual’s own or other cells.   |
| 3D Flat-panel TVs And Displays |   |   | Two technologies are currently used to show 3D images on the majority of flat-panel TVs and displays: polarization 3D, which uses a pattern retarder and polarized glasses and is only offered by a small number of display manufacturers; and alternate-frame sequencing, which uses active shutter glasses and requires high refresh rates on displays. Autostereoscopic displays, which use lenticular lenses or parallax barrier technology built into the display panel, and which do not require glasses to view the 3D effect, are used primarily in digital signage and have limited appeal in the consumer market.  |
| 3D LCDs |   |   | **Three-dimensional liquid crystal display (3D LCD)** technology enables users to view 3D images either with 3D glasses (stereoscopic LCDs) or without 3D glasses (autostereoscopic LCDs). For smaller screen sizes (typically up to 10 inches), directional backlight 3D is a cost-effective technology that uses the LCD’s backlight to change the viewing fields for the left and right eyes sequentially, thereby creating image depth.  |
| 3D Photovoltaic Devices |   |   | **3D photovoltaic (PV)** devices employ a 3D structure to improve photoelectric efficiency by increasing the amount of light captured by the light-absorbing material in the PV cell or panel. By comparison, conventional solar cells consist of a 2D planar diode structure. By utilizing a 3D design, the surface area available for light absorption is increased, and some designs incorporate nanostructures such as wells, towers or nanotubes intended to trap photons, increasing the proportion that impart their energy to the PV cell. Once the sunlight strikes the 3D solar panel, the 3D design will trap the sunlight and help bounce the photons (many times) until they have been fully converted into electrons and hence usable electricity. 3D solar cells may also include features intended to reduce the rate of recombination of electron-hole pairs. 3D PV technology can also improve solar cell performance by reducing light reflection. 3D PV technology has the potential to produce much-higher-efficiency PV cells, panels and systems; however, it is still too early to determine what the real-world efficiency will be. The key challenge for commercialization of this technology will be developing a low-cost manufacturing process that can translate the efficiency gains into lower-cost solar electricity. |
| 3D Printing |   |   | **3D printing** is an additive technique that uses a device to create physical objects from digital models.  |
| 3D Scanners |   |   | A **three-dimensional scanner** is a device that captures data about the shape and appearance of real-world objects to create 3D models of them. 3D scanners for consumer use are low-cost, easy-to-operate devices that provide basic scan, capture and export of 3D images. |
| 3D TV Services |   |   | **Three-dimensional television (3D TV)** services deliver 3D images to TV sets using stereoscopic imaging: where two slightly different images are superposed and transmitted to each eye. There are several technologies currently used to deliver 3D images on TV sets. They fall into two broad groups: those that require glasses, and those that don’t.  |
| 3G (Third Generation) |   |   | 3G wireless networks support peak data rates of 144 Kbps at mobile user speeds, 384 Kbps at pedestrian user speeds and 2 Mbps in fixed locations (peak speeds), although some initial deployments were configured to support only 64 Kbps. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) coordinates 3G standards through its International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) project and incorporates the key standards bodies, Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and 3GPP2. See also High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) and Long Term Evolution (LTE).  |
| 3GPP (Third-generation Partnership Project) |   |   | Collaborative project among various standards bodies, such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and enterprise application integration-41 (EAI-41), under the auspices of the ITU, which is developing global specifications for the evolution of 3G technologies. 3GPP focuses on the evolution of GSM and WCDMA, while 3GPP2 focuses on the evolution of cdma2000.  |
| 450-mm Wafers |   |   | A **450-millimeter (mm)-diameter silicon wafer** is the next wafer-size transition for semiconductor manufacturing. 450-mm wafers provide 2.25 times the area of a 300-mm wafer and thus increase the number of devices that can be processed at one time. Depending on the device die size, up to 2.5 times more devices can be placed on a 450-mm wafer than on a 300-mm wafer. |
| 4G Standard |   |   | The **fourth generation (4G) Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) standard** is for next-generation local- and wide-area mobile platforms supporting high peak data rates; handover between wireless bearer technologies; Internet Protocol (IP) core and radio transport networks for voice, video and data services; and support for call control and signaling. With peak data rates of 100 Mbps in WANs and 1 Gbps in fixed or low-mobility situations, and all-IP core, radio access and transport networks, 4G will be mostly implemented as LTE-A. |
| 4K X 2K TV Displays |   |   | **4K x 2K** is a screen resolution for next-generation HDTVs. The screen format is 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels, which offers a total resolution of 8.3 megapixels. This is a four-fold improvement in resolution compared with current 1080 HD screens, which offer only a total resolution of 2.1 megapixels. 4K x 2K is also a digital cinema format.  |
| 5 Whys |   |   | A form of root-cause analysis that entails asking “why” (at least) five times until the underlying causes of an outcome are understood. |
| 5G |   |   | 5G is the next-generation cellular standard after 4G. It has been defined across several global standards bodies, including the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), 3GPP and ETSI. The official ITU specification, International Mobile Telecommunications-2020, targets maximum downlink and uplink throughputs of 20 Gbps and 10 Gbps, respectively; latency below 5 ms endpoint to RAN; and massive scalability, although initial deployments may be less ambitious. New system architecture includes core network slicing and edge computing.  |
| 5S |   |   | Five-part checklist to help eliminate waste in the workplace: In Japanese — “Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu and Shitsuke”; loosely translated as “Sort, Straighten, Sanitize, Standardize and Sustain.” Using the 5S approach is frequently a “kaizen event.”  |
| 64-bit Windows Server |   |   | The Windows Server operating system running in full 64-bit mode on Intel or AMD x86 processors is known as **64-bit Windows Server**. Most instances of Windows Server ran in 32-bit mode, even if hosted on a machine whose hardware supported 64-bit mode, up until Windows Server 2008 R2 began shipping. From that point forward, Windows Server will only operate in 64-bit mode, and all new installations are, therefore, 64-bit.  |
| 6LoWPAN |   |   | **6LoWPAN** is the name of an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard that defines an approach for routing Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) over low-power wireless networks. 6LoWPAN is intended to bring the benefits of standard IP networking to low-power mesh and sensor networks, which, in the past, often used proprietary technologies. 6LoWPAN uses a compact representation of IPv6 and can be implemented in a small footprint protocol stack appropriate for devices with limited processing power and memory.  |
| 7 Wastes |   |   | A framework of seven types of activity that do not add value; originally defined by Toyota: overproducing — producing product before there’s a valid order; unnecessary waiting — lengthened cycle time, which reduces agility; unnecessary transportation — unnecessary transportation of material between sites; overprocessing — processes longer or more complex than necessary; unnecessary inventory — buildup of work-in-process or raw materials; unnecessary movement — inefficient workplace; layout causing extra work; and too many defects — poor process quality and too much rework. This list was extended by Gartner and others to include an eighth waste: asset underutilization or other underutilization of resources. The eight wastes are often referred to by the acronym “DOWNTIME,” meaning “Defects, Overproduction, Waiting, Nonutilized resources, Transportation, Inventory, Motion and Excessive processing.”  |

| Absorption Chillers  | Чиллерҳои ҷазбӣ  | Абсорбционные чиллеры  | **Absorption chillers** use a different mechanism from traditional chillers, and are powered by heat rather than using electricity, potentially resulting in significant efficiency gains. The cooling mechanism is still evaporative — a liquid transforming into a vapor — but the reliquification is different. Instead of being compressed, the vapor is absorbed into another liquid. The classic cycle here uses ammonia, which is absorbed into water. |
| Access Method  | Тарзи дастрасӣ  | Метод доступа  | An **access method** is: 1. The portion of a computer’s operating system responsible for formatting data sets and their direction to specific storage devices. Examples from the mainframe world include Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) and Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM). 2. In local-area networks, the technique or program code used to arbitrate the use of the communications medium by granting access selectively to individual stations. Examples are Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA-CD) and token passing.  |
| Access Point (AP)  | Нуқтаи дастрасӣ (НД)  | Точка доступа  | An **access point** is a pico base station or network access point in a WLAN radio network, consisting of a radio (often more than one) and a network connection, enabling WLAN clients to access network resources connected to a home or enterprise network.  |
| Accountable Care Organization (ACO) | Созмони муроқибати посухгӯ (ACO) | Организация подотчетной помощи (ACO)| **Accountable care organization (ACO)** is an umbrella term for a major switch in contracting between providers and public or private payers. In an ACO model, a group of providers, operating as a legal entity, contracts to assume some portion of the risk for cost and quality for a panel of beneficiaries through a variety of value-based payment models over a specified period of time. ACOs include primary care services. The U.S. CMS Distributed Shared Savings Program, which began operation in 2012, is one version of this model.  |
| Accredited Standards Committee (ASC)  | Кумитаи истондорди муътабар | Аккредитованный комитет по стандартам (ASC) | The **Accredited Standards Committee (ASC)** is an organization, certified by the American National Standards Institute, that produces standard communication protocols for electronic data interchange. |
| Active Data Dictionary  | Фарҳанги луғати додафаъол | Словарь активных данных | An **active data dictionary** facility for storing dynamically accessible and modifiable information relating to midrange-system data definitions and descriptions.  |
| Active Directory  | Директории фаъол | Активная директория | **Active Directory** is the “directory service” portion of the Windows 2000 operating system. Active Directory manages the identities and relationships of the distributed resources that make up a network environment. It stores information about network-based entities (e.g., applications, files, printers and people) and provides a consistent way to name, describe, locate, access, manage and secure information about these resources. It the central authority that manages the identities and brokers the relationships between these distributed resources, enabling them to work together.  |
| Active Matrix Organic Light-emitting Diodes (AMOLED)  |   |   | **Active matrix organic light-emitting diodes (AMOLEDs)** consist of pixels of electroluminescent organic compounds “printed” in a matrix onto a base layer. This base layer is currently glass and will be further developed to use flexible polymers in the future. Unlike liquid crystal displays, OLED displays do not require a backlight and consume very little power, making them suitable for battery-powered devices. AMOLEDs use a thin film transistor (TFT) to control the pixels.  |
| ActiveX  |   |   | **ActiveX** is an application programming interface (API) that enhances Microsoft’s OLE protocol. Often compared to Java, ActiveX facilitates various Internet applications, and therefore extends and enhances the functionality of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser. Like Java, ActiveX enables the development of interactive content. When an ActiveX-aware browser encounters a Web page that includes an unfamiliar feature, it automatically installs the appropriate applications so the feature can be used.  |
